In recent years I have been tired and lazy every day, so I made a decision a week ago that I would slowly crawl towards change. Perhaps everything will change in the future and I really want to believe in it. And yes, forgive me for my English, because I don’t know it, but I’m using a translator. I'm from Russia myself...
